Random Forests Implementation

This is an implementation of Random Forests in Python 3 to realize its working as a regressor and as a classifier.

## Classifier:
The classification example is based on Sonar dataset.
The dataset can be downloaded from this link: [UCI Sonar Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/undocumented/connectionist-bench/sonar/)

The example can be run as:
``python classify.py``
 
## Regressor:
The regression example is based on facial keypoints detection dataset.
The dataset can be downloaded from this link: [Kaggle Facial Keypoints Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data)

The example code can be run as:
``python regress.py``
