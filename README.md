Random Forests Implementation
This implementation is a simple attempt to realize the working of random forests in Python 3.

## Classifier:
The classification example is based on Sonar dataset.
The dataset can be downloaded from this link: 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/undocumented/connectionist-bench/sonar/

The example can be run as:
``python classify.py``
 
## Regressor:
The regression example is based on kaggle facial keypoints detection dataset.
The dataset can be downloaded from this link: 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data

The example code can be run as:
``python regress.py``
